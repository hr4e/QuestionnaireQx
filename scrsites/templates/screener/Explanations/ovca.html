        Cancer of the ovary starts in the ovary, the organ that produces eggs in females.
         The ovary has several types of cells.  Cancer in  the
        “epithelial” cells of the ovary, is associated with BRCA mutations. Up to 60% of women (6 in 10)
        who get epithelial ovarian cancer have a mutation in the BRCA genes.
